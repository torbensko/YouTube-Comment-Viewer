--- PURPOSE ---

This code allows you to view all the comments for a particular YouTube video.
Unlike the comments page on YouTube, this system provides precise tiemstamps
for each comment. This code was written to help me examine whether the public
reaction to certain videos changed over time

--- SETTING UP ---

1. To run the script locally, move the repo files into a folder served up by
your local server, such as /Library/WebServer/Documents on OSX

2. Lauch your web browser and navigate to the index.php via your local server
(i.e. make sure your URL starts with "http:" not "file:"). For example, if
placed in a folder called youtube_fetch, navigate to:
http://localhost/youtube_fetch

3. Once open the use of the system should be pretty obvious
